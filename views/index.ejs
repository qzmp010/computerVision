                        <h2>What Is Computer Vision?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Computer Vision is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables machines to
                            interpret and
                            understand visual information from the world — just like humans do with their eyes and
                            brain. Using
                            cameras and advanced algorithms, a computer vision system can detect, recognize, and track
                            objects
                            such as people, vehicles, road signs, and traffic lights.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In simple terms, computer vision allows a machine to <em>see</em>, <em>analyze</em>, and
                            <em>act</em> based on what it observes.

                        <h2>What Are Autonomous Vehicles?</h2>
                        <p>
                            An <strong>autonomous vehicle</strong> (often called a self-driving car) is a car that can
                            sense its
                            environment and navigate without human input. These vehicles rely on a combination of
                            sensors,
                            cameras, radar, and AI software to make driving decisions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are <strong>five levels of driving automation</strong>, defined by the Society of
                            Automotive
                            Engineers (SAE):
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Level 0</strong> - No automation (human fully in control).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Level 1</strong> - Driver assistance (e.g., cruise control).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Level 2</strong> - Partial automation (lane centering + speed control).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Level 3</strong> - Conditional automation (car drives itself but may need human
                                intervention).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Level 4-5</strong> - High and full automation (no human driver required).
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Most current cars, such as Tesla’s Autopilot, are around <em>Level 2</em> or <em>Level
                                3</em>.</p>
